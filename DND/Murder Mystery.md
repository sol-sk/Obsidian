Horse at bar, Escuro goes to speak to him

Ostridge, speaking to friars

Mouse woman, beaver woman, outside door to bathroom, ('quiet luxury')

Lady Findebear: older ostridge woman, a little hunched over, ruby necklace

*Rolling perception on room (15)*
- Ostridge and friars by bar–bartender is ignoring ostridge as he tries to order drink
- Well dressed male arctic fox, w/ rubies and amber woven into his suit

*Perception on Lady Findebear (20)*
- Learning on Yasha's chair, clutching it like she can't stand, he offers her chair 
- Hair teased, sliding around; you can see her hair is thinning
- looks way worse than last time
- sickly skinny
- hands shaking 
- in conversation; looks like her attention is jumping around room, can't focus on Yasha
- Sweating through very heavy makeup, also looks shivering
- Tongue wagging uncontrollably, slurring
- Bloody cough into handkerchief
- Eyes look yellowed

- Rat woman also in charge (has worked here for a long time)
- Badger woman 
- Circus performers seated around
	- Leeland the mini horse

	- Logan spills the beans
	- Is now in the dark crypt
#### Back to bar 
Doorbell ringing, barking
"You piece of shit how dare you show up here after disappearing for a YEAR"

Findebear 


> [!info] Oliver Shout
> - Famous in the paper
> - Bumbling vigilante/PI
> - Hated by police bc of his shit

Findebear and Yasha go out door into main hall; I follow super stealthily

#### Entrance
Severil has pinned Ike to the wall angrily
Yasha says "this is a close friend to me and you will treat him with respect"
Severil drops Ike
- Severil: "if he dies on these grounds i will be the one who killed him"

Hedge is now overgrown over the driveway we entered through 

*Perception on Ike (17)*
- Haven't seen him in a year
- Still well dressed young man, like I remember
- Appearance is quite different to what it used to be; effeminate in a "guy reading poetry" way 
	- Fancier, more intricate garments
- Face looks quite different; would be difficult to recognize if I didn't know him quite well

Yasha catches me as i try to get back in (-2 bludgeoning); i try to distract, say hello to Ike, who says he doesn't recognize me, name is Dr. James OMuyerl ??

Get back inside

#### Main dining room
Art deco Badger woman moves her place setting to end of the table, pockets other name card
Young male badger (servant) rushes behind the bar and out the door

Leonard is seated at the end of the table furthest from the door, next to James (spider)
- I ask "come here often" and he sayd are you hitting on me and i say no and he says i woul dhave told you if you were... no, i've never been here before (we wink)

*Perception on dining room (21)*
Tablecloth is charred at my table; *investigation (17)*
- Either intentionally set out that way or very, very recently
- James asks if i was at the dinner last year; says i hope something that funny happens again, the same performer is here, they are so bad

Nazari (Russian lynx; sword swallower)

**Valencia (Logan)**: fire juggler (begins @7)
- Visibly wasted
- Throws up, it lights on fire bc of all the drinking

7:20: fire put out

Beaver woman
*Insight on her; (1)*
- Who knows!
- (other insight check: she came in through a diff entrace, which you would need Findebear's room key for)

*Insight on Molly (19+1)*
- She takes over for Joanna, who leaves when everyone had stepped out for the fire to be put out
- She seems very comfortable taking over, and it seems the fire was not the primary reason for Joanna to leave

**Talking to James**
- Molly and Joanna known each other for a long time, been preparing for a while
- Asks if I'm Leonard Hopper, I say no, he says hm.. ok and i go for sure "James"

Abbott and one friar are missing 

Go to the bathroom, run into Oliver, we introduce ourselves, I see the super wet bathroom 
- We hear a thud from far away, Oliver leaves
- Also hear the door break
- Table reset, Molly is back, Dylan is back, Yasha introduces next performance; cannonball catcher

**In bathroom**

#### Courtyard (Leonard not present)
- Valencia with dog, found dead body of other dog
- Oliver scaling building towards third floor where moolia is 
- Severil sees Oliver, hears bark where Valencia is 

**Findebear's Greenhouse**
- Plants are strange looking! Many have warning labels 
- See John Wembly's body seemingly pushed out of Joanna's window 
	- Not wet 

**Findebear's bathroom** (7:45)
- Blood puddled around sink and on floor, none in bathtub
- Window over tub: out window, can see Wembly's body 
- Bloody clothes and towels all hidden in cabinet under sink
- Medium sized build (smaller than Yasha, bigger than Marsha)
- Failed investigation on medicine cabinet
