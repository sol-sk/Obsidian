#### Setting: April 1831

Boarding school 
Late 20s; been in force for <5 years
Know: Ike Snyder, Colonel Sebastian Morel 
Egg 
Extrovert
Father judge/magistrate
### In police force
- Write quarterlies pursuit (anon) on behalf of Bow Street runners, aka public announcements about what crime has happened
- Interviews

Chosen to go on investigation why? 
- Because Father has enough $ to fund it 
- Weird gay vibe 
- Air of nobility/used to high customs

As firstborn son, supposed to go into politics or military, failed both; thus police force

### Snyder + Colonel 
In Apr 1830 when Ike Snyder goes missing: publically a friend of mine, so **Captain Lark Maxwell** approaches and explains the pattern + number of missing ppl + attachment to the estate

After dishon discharge, it would be known that only place that would hire Colonel is Findebear's estate
- Hired 2 months after Snyder's disappearance; solidifies connection btwn missing persons and estate 

#### Rosemary Wise
- Missing April 1830 (same time as Snyder)
- "went on spiritual journey to India"
- Heiress to mining fortune
Right before missing: did a bunch of paintings that seemed "freaky and kind of gay"
- Written about in *Purple Haze*
- Paintings released under pseudonym "Archie Rise", so Wises deny any relation
- Abstract so plausible deniability about gayness


*Purple Haze*
- Run by Christina Colleran (and is only paper she writes in)
- Underground seedy zine 
- interviews
- writes about queer art
- not explicitly gay
- artsy/strange
- Collaborator occassionally: Edward Burns 
	- Thinkpieces/news about people hung or prosecuted for sodomy charges
	- Writes in lots of papers

### Visits to Estate (6 total before fundraiser)

1. Toinette
2. Smoke
3. Harry 
4. Toinette
5. Smoke - see Sev + Mastiff talking
6. Toinette - tearful sex

**Rooms visited:**
	Main foyer, upstairs foyer, toinettes room + accompanying bathroom, smoking lounge, main bathroom on first floor, stable house first floor (main living space), harrys room (which has hookah and accompanying bathroom)
#### 1st visit
Difficult to tell when other guests are around 
One time I'm there, Mastiff guard is on couch, rest of times he's just walking
First visit, I can hear him closer outside, afterwards, less close 

Referred by **Ike Snyder**
Sent telegram requesting driver to pick up to house staff (not to stablehands)
First time at brothel: go to smoking lounge and point out which one to see, afterwards can request by initial 
- Chose Toinette first time, go with her to room

**Toinette**
- Fled France 
- Full time
- Jaguar
- Met 3x 
- Red and orange, high quality bedclothes

**In Toinettes room**
- Asked not to wander much, but barred doors are locked, security patrols 
- Can go to smoking room, drink, etc. 
- Fled France 5 years ago with Ella
- Ella has known Lady Findebear for a long time, worked in estate for ~10 yrs
- Met Toinette in brothel in France, not great conditions so they left together 
- We go to smoking lounge 

#### 2nd Visit Dustin McCloud 
- Stablehand
- Teenager
- Magpie
- Working in stable since 1828 when he turned 15
- Been living and working in house since 1808 (his whole life); his mother Claudia is head cook 
- Shares his room w 2 other people- Will McMyers + Michael Artag'nyan (waitstaff/busboy) - Badger, started working same time as Dustin, but doesn't have biological connection (only people who have family also working are Dustin + William)
- Has dreams of going to university to study sciences/biology, move to London
- Mother Claudia is almost able to afford apartment outside house to move out 
- But job is great + good opportunity, just wants to travel the world, hasn't been off estate much 
- Gossip vibes, house staff will learn a lot about me after talking to him
- Shows me around stable house 

Maxine - deer girl stable hand, ushers us out, tells Dustin to stfu 

Dustin will remember my chauffer's name forever

#### 3rd visit - Harry 
Snyder, in referral, would have expressed his extreme distain for Alasdair (lazy, terrible, stupid), Alasdair has highest rates and he's the worst and that Harry is only "respectable one there," only good male prostitute, smart, doesn't "give it all away"

**Harry**
- Mountain goat
- Has 2nd job in city 
- Mostly in on weekends 
- Wears full suit

As we walk to his room, he explains that he is not known for small talk, and if you're clear and direct, you can have a great time 

I would say that I'm looking for good conversation, we go have a drink, etc 
I tell him I'm new to the brothel, looking for a less boring less conventional world fed up with life

He has worked a lot in tight laced env., understands the difficulty of "balancing depravity with public life." "Your anonymity is a remarkable tool. Your measure of your personal strength is your ability to maintain standings and life in city while finding fulfillment in other contexts." 

Suit is something he's ascended to that he refuses to compromise on; considers work to be respectable, not seedy - time when he couldn't afford nice suits, when they were above his station 

We talk about tailors; he has tailor friend who he uses as connection to buy materials and he makes all his suits himself as well as for other people in the estate (i ask for clients or other employees of estate, he says they're all clients to him)

Accent is somewhat British/Londoner, but not super naturally - German twinge that he's trying to hide


#### 5th visit: Walking around house/Meeting Mastiff (no prostitute)
Realize I lost pocketwatch after 4th visit, come back to ask and smoke
- Pocketwatch has my initials on it but i don't mention this, I do say that there's decorative engravings 

**Dr. John Wembly - mastiff**:
	Sorry haven't seen your watch
	Staff do sometimes find things, I'll keep an eye out
	Ms. Dylan Kinelli may have more information 
	Thank him, give him my alias, he gives me his "name": John
	Recognizes me as one of Toinette's regulars, has been working here since before she arrived

We go up to have a drink
- He's local to london, spent time in military as medical officer in america, got injured, this job was both medical and security so what he was looking for 
- Has become good friends with Lady Findebear over the years, him and Sebastian are the only ones who don't live on the grounds 
- House has been getting quieter over the past 6 months - eerily so 
	- Missing people, bad rumors, nothing he wants to share
- Whiskey neat 
#### Smoking lounge/Bar
First time: Little fox bartender 
- Wore rosary - recognize it as similar to Snyder's
Second time: Female badger
- Dressed in drab colors, also w/ rosary, but this is diff than fox's
- Doesn

Outdoor smoking area or backyard give view of outdoors area

#### 6th (last) visit
Toinette and I finally have sex and I cry and it's final straw for the whole egg thing and what prompts her to invite me to fundraiser

She says: 
Once a year there's a fundraiser with Dr. Vasiliev's traveling circus
many people like you have found solace talking to dr. Vasiliev, it'll be fun, food,
Only regulars and those vouched for will be there so you don't have to worry about cover etc. 
Tix. are Â£200 (more than the avg. working class yearly salary)

2nd string of missing people; no confirmed connection to manor, but all (thru grapevine knowledge) involved in seedy shit akin to brothel
