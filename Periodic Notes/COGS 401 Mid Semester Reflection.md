Reflection (2%) 

In addition to the visual mind map, you will include a short write-up (maximum 1 page) sketching out some potential next steps and discussing the potential significance of your work (i.e., what gap does it fill)


Next steps:

I already have a second meeting scheduled with T'ai Smith, an art history professor at UBC who I've been  talking to as a potential supervisor for my 402 project. She recommended a few texts for me to readâ€“a few of which ended up as a part of my mind map. I plan to continue with these readings that she suggested as well as investigating more on the psychology end what sort of research has been done in the perception of minds as well as on perception in general. I'm not sure if I want to explore any psychology research on perception of art, since I think that I'm using each as a separate methodological approach to my research question, and things will get even messier if I use my methodologies on each other as well. My proposal encompasses a lot of different ideas, and I had a hard enough time putting everything together for the flash talk, so I think I am going to have to cut some parts of this research out in order to make it tenable for at least meeting the deadlines in this class. I am also interested in further researching the power of visualization in pedagogy, and how this can relate to both viewing and creating artwork. 

While there is literature on the overlap between psychology and art, cybernetics notwithstanding, it does appear that such literature is lagging well behind recent advances in either field. I'm hoping that with my project, I can integrate more contemporary concepts in both art and psychology in order to put forward new research in this field. Even if I simplify my proposal a considerable amount, I believe that there is not yet much literature on visual processing as it relates to self and other-mind perception. 

Given the research I have already found on the relationship between perceived agency and perceived humanity, including positive human traits and moral standing, I think there are potentially a variety of consequential implications to mind perception.
